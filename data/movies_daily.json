This new version removes the cliffhanger ending from Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and the recap that began Kill Bill: Vol. 2, and adds a very brief intermission to separate the two volumes. It also includes a never-before-seen 7½-minute animated sequence, and restores to colour the 'House of Blue Leaves' fight sequence that was first presented in black and white in the U.S. theatrical cut to avoid an NC-17 rating.
