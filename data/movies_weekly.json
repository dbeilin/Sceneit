There have been some memorable puppet-theatre performances of opera, but with Caligula Le Poème Harmonique and Arcal invite us to savour something quite original by bringing together two artistic traditions that have long been separated: those of Venetian opera and Sicilian puppet-theatre. On stage, the singers and instrumentalists, conducted by Vincent Dumestre, lend their voices and rich sound to the pupi of Mimmo Cuticchio, large stick-puppets belonging to a great theatrical tradition dating back to the seventeenth century.",

I would suggest try to find something in your actual life that you're afraid of, if anything. It doesn't even have to be horror. For instance, if you're afraid of drowning, you could watch \"Last Breath\", space \"Event Horizon\", etc..  Then try to find movies that involve that aspect in them. For me, it was \"The Fourth Kind\". I happened to be working in Alaska when it came out so that added to it."
