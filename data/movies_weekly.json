A guy does psychedelics and dies (which isn't a spoiler... it happens in the first few minutes) and the movie is his consciousness floating around seeing how his death has impacted his friends and his sister. It's disorienting, vulgar, grotesque, it's obscene at times. It has some of the most visceral depictions of trauma I've seen on screen. It's definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed the unique experience.\n\nAlso, severe photo-sensitivity warning. If you're at all sensitive to flashing lights, be careful with this one."
